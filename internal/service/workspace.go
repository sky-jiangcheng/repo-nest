// Workspace path resolution (ADR-0009 thin client, and the same need for agents).
//
// The question this answers is the one an IDE and an agent both ask and the
// backend could not answer before: "I am standing in this directory — which
// project is mine?" ResolveProject matches a needle INSIDE a project's root_path,
// so a subdirectory — the normal case for a multi-repository project — never
// matches, and the repositories table, which does record the subdirectory, was
// never consulted at all.
//
// Four tiers, most specific first. The ordering is the whole design:
//
//	1. a repository stored at exactly this path            → that repository's project
//	2. the deepest repository path that is an ancestor     → that repository's project
//	3. a project rooted at exactly this path               → that project
//	4. the deepest project root_path that is an ancestor   → that project
//
// Tiers 1-2 beat 3-4 because a repository match carries more information: it
// names the module, not just the container.
//
// Tier 4 is restricted, and that restriction is load-bearing rather than
// defensive. This database contains an auto-grouped project rooted at the user's
// home directory (a scan-time catch-all container). Letting containers win by
// ancestry means every folder under home resolves to it, and the session gets the
// wrong project's knowledge with no signal that anything was guessed — strictly
// worse than "unresolved, pick one". An auto-grouped project may still match
// EXACTLY (tier 3): deliberately opening that folder is a real answer.
//
// Nothing here guesses across a mismatch. If no tier fires, the caller gets the
// candidate catalog plus an explicit reason, which is the same rule
// renderProjectCatalog already applies for an ambiguous name.

// ResolveProjectByPath resolves an absolute directory (an IDE workspace folder, or
