// The snapshot itself is written by a trigger (see internal/db/wiki_versions.go),
// so there is deliberately no "save a version" entry point here: a Go-side writer
// would be a second, forgettable path to the same fact, and the one that can be
// skipped is the one that gets skipped.
//
// What lives here is only what the review surface needs to LOOK: the list, and a
// diff of one snapshot against the live page. Neither can change anything, which is
// the whole reason the history view is safe to expose without a gate on it.

// ListWikiPageVersions returns a page's snapshots, newest first. A page that has
// never had approved content returns an empty list rather than an error — "no
// history yet" is a fact about the page, not a failure.
