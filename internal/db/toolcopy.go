// Throwaway copies for tooling (the cmd/wiki-rehearse discipline, made reusable).
//
// Why. Several binaries under cmd/ are analysis or export tools: abeval measures
// retrieval quality, queryset builds a labelling worksheet, wiki-export renders the
// page layer to Markdown. None of them should change the user's database. Yet all
// three opened their `-db` argument (which defaults to the live application
// database) through InitDB — and InitDB runs upgradeSchema, which writes: it stamps
// schema_version, creates tables, and backfills. So "run the evaluation tool"
// silently migrated the production database as a side effect of opening it.
//
// abeval is worse than a migration surprise: with an embedding endpoint configured
// it calls service.RebuildEmbeddings, which rewrites the whole note index and
// persists embedding_dim. An A/B gate that mutates the thing it is measuring is not
// a measurement.
//
// So: open the source strictly read-only, copy it with VACUUM INTO a temp file, and
// hand the caller a database that is a real Repotory database at the CURRENT schema
// — with every write, migration and index rebuild landing on the copy. This is the
// same shape cmd/wiki-rehearse already used; promoting it here means the next
// analysis tool starts safe instead of rediscovering why.
//
// The copy is a snapshot: reads are point-in-time and immune to the desktop app
// writing underneath them, which for a tool that prints a report is the correct
// semantics anyway.

// OpenCopyOptions tunes CopyForTooling. The zero value is the safe default.
