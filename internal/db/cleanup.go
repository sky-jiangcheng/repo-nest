// The empty case is not "the user deleted every repository" — it is
// indistinguishable from "the scan found nothing because the walk failed, the
// roots are unreadable, or the disk was unmounted". Treating it as
// authoritative deleted every repository and stat in the knowledge base, and
// that data cannot be reconstructed without re-reading git history from every
// project.
//
// Callers must treat this as a hard error, not as a no-op: silently skipping
// the cleanup would let genuinely-removed repos linger forever, which is the
// milder and recoverable failure.

// rather than deleting every repository and stat. See that error for why.
