# Knowledge Base and Notes

The knowledge base is the app's home page and the hub for cross-project notes: Markdown / block editor, tag categories, FTS5 full-text search, version history, and AI memory import.

```

How to read it: one **trunk (edit → save → snapshot → diff → restore)** plus one **branch (index → search)**. The trunk solves "knowledge must not be lost"; the branch solves "knowledge must be findable" — both are triggered by the same save action (snapshots via a write trigger, the index via the FTS sync trigger), so there is no save button to remember. The **History** button on a note card enters the version side; the search box enters the branch.

## Managing notes

- **Create a note**: pick a project in "Quick create note" on the home page, or create one from the notes panel on the project detail page
- **Metadata**: title (falls back to the first line if left empty), tags (comma-separated), category (knowledge / log / idea / other), pinned
- **Move across projects**: use the "Linked project" dropdown while editing to migrate in one click
- **Autosaved drafts**: edits are saved locally in real time, so nothing is lost if the app closes unexpectedly

## Block editor

Type `/` to open the block panel and insert structured blocks:

| Block | Description |
|----|------|
| Callout | TIP / WARNING / NOTE callouts |
| Code block | with language highlighting |
| Mermaid diagram | flowcharts / sequence diagrams, etc. |
| Math formula | rendered with KaTeX |
| Todo list / table / divider | common structures |
| Collapsible block / Tabs | `<details>` and `{% tabs %}` |

- Blocks can be drag-sorted, moved up or down, and deleted individually
- **Switch between Markdown and blocks at any time**: the storage format is always plain Markdown, so any editor can open it

## Rich rendering

highlight.js code highlighting, Mermaid diagrams, KaTeX math formulas, GFM callouts, and task lists.

## Search

- The home page search box is auto-focused; "Ask the knowledge base" mode returns answer snippets ranked by relevance
- FTS5 trigram + bm25 ranking, with snippets highlighting matched terms; short CJK queries automatically fall back to LIKE
- Covers notes and todos; the `⌘/Ctrl+K` command palette works from anywhere

### Semantic search (optional, off by default)

Lexical search answers "which characters matched", not "the same fact phrased differently". Optional vector recall covers exactly that blind spot:

- **Two-stage fusion**: FTS5 and vector recall are merged with RRF (k=60); vectors only ever **add** — if any step fails (endpoint unset, request error, index missing) it falls back to the pure lexical result, so **turning it on cannot return fewer hits**. That is a design constraint, not a reassurance.
- **Off by default**: active only when `semantic_search=1` **and** an embedding endpoint is configured (`embedding_base_url` + `embedding_model`). The settings page does not expose these yet; enable them via the configuration keys described in [AI Integration](ai-integration.md).
- **The first time needs one full rebuild**: every note's text is embedded, which is an O(all notes) walk of the endpoint. It also persists the vector dimension it discovers.
- **No further rebuilds afterwards**: note creation, title/body edits and deletions are queued by SQLite triggers and drained in the background every 5 seconds — live notes get re-embedded, deleted notes are removed from the vector index (otherwise text you deleted keeps showing up in recall). Three deliberate conservations: pinning, retagging and moving a note do **not** trigger an embed (they do not change the text sent to the endpoint); when the endpoint is unavailable the work stays queued and retries, so an offline laptop loses nothing; and when the dimension is unknown or the index does not exist yet it skips rather than guessing.
- **Imported notes are indexed the same way**: queueing happens in database triggers, and every writer (UI, MCP, CLI, agent-memory importers) converges on that layer — which is precisely why this was not built into application logic.
- **Privacy boundary**: enabling semantic search means note text is sent to the embedding endpoint you configured (local Ollama or a remote API, depending on `embedding_base_url`). That is an explicit choice, off by default; `embedding_api_key` and `vector_store_api_key` are secrets, returned masked when configuration is read and never handed to the UI.
- **The vector index is a derived cache**; the notes themselves are the source of truth: it can be dropped and recomputed at any time, living in the same database file as the notes, in the same transactions and the same backups (pure-Go sqlite-vec, zero CGO). A remote vector store is only worth reaching for at real scale — see [AI Integration](ai-integration.md).
- **Whether it helps is measurable before it ships**: `cmd/abeval` runs "lexical vs lexical+vector" against a live database and reports Recall@k / NDCG@k with a threshold gate — again against a throwaway copy, so it writes nothing to your database. The gate comes before the switch deliberately — until there is a real labelled query set, no UI toggle ships.

## Version history

A snapshot is created automatically on every save (the latest 50 are kept). The **History** button on the note card opens:

- A version list (time, title)
- A line-level LCS diff of any version vs the current one (+/- markers)
- One-click restore to any historical version

## Import knowledge from agent memory

Six built-in sources idempotently import the memory and session transcripts you already left in other agent tools as knowledge notes (re-importing updates existing notes instead of duplicating them):

| Source | Trigger | Reads |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `claude` | automatic at startup | `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/*.md` |
| `codex` | manual | session transcripts `rollout-*.jsonl` (first instruction + last reply) |
| `opencode` | manual | session titles and summaries |
| `openclaw` | manual | `~/.openclaw-autoclaw/workspace/*.md` |
| `hermes` | manual | `~/.hermes/memories/{MEMORY,USER}.md` |
| `cursor` | manual | Cursor sessions inside `globalStorage/state.vscdb` (best effort, see below) |

**Settings → Plugins** lists every source, lets you trigger each one manually, and shows the per-source `{created, updated, skipped}` counters.

Three rules that are easy to trip over:

1. **Imports land on a project, they do not pile onto the knowledge home page.** Documents are matched to a specific project by project name / repository path; whatever does not match is counted as `skipped` and not stored. So scan the projects first — hit rate depends on that order.
2. **`openclaw` and `hermes` need their target project configured first** (`openclaw_project` / `hermes_project`); otherwise the entire source is silently skipped.
3. **A repeat import is not a failure.** `created=0` plus `updated=N` means idempotency worked and the content was refreshed.

**`cursor` is the only best-effort source**: Cursor's on-disk format is undocumented and versioned, so it takes only the **first prompt and last reply** of each session (never a full transcript), resolves ownership through `workspaceStorage/<id>/workspace.json` and skips what it cannot match rather than guessing — and when the database shape is not one it recognizes, **the whole source fails loudly instead of quietly importing zero notes** (because "nothing imported" must stay distinguishable from "you have no sessions"). Every read opens that file `mode=ro`; another application's data is never written.

Imported notes carry `kind` = `knowledge` (memory files) or `log` (session records) and are findable by full-text search as soon as they are written; with semantic search enabled they are also picked up by vector recall without another rebuild (see above). Full paths, matching rules and limitations per source are in [Knowledge source plugins](../plugins/overview.md).

## Knowledge pages and the review queue

Notes are the **raw record**; pages are the **compiled artifact**. The same fact can live in a note (who did what, when, how) and still grow concept and entity pages linked to each other in a graph — the shape `project_notes` cannot express on its own, since a note hangs off a project and references nothing else.

| Page kind | Holds |
|-----------|-------|
| `entity` | A concrete thing (module, service, repository, person) |
| `concept` | An idea (idempotency key, session timeout, scan-depth semantics) |
| `source` | A summary page for one source document |
| `synthesis` | Cross-source synthesis and conclusions |
| `query` | A filed answer from Q&A (see "File as page" in [AI Integration](ai-integration.md)) |

The page layer is a **derived cache**: notes remain the source of truth, the whole layer can be dropped and rebuilt (`DropWikiSchema`), and if it is dropped it grows back on the next open.

### Edges between pages: a controlled relation vocabulary (schema v21)

Pages are wired into a graph by **directed links**, and every link carries a **relation type**. Early on that type was free text (the compiler wrote `compiled-from`, a filed answer wrote `cites`, and the model wrote whatever it liked), so "what are all the dependency links in this graph" was unanswerable. v21 ([ADR-0018](../adr/0018-knowledge-graph-foundation.md), first half) freezes it into eight enumerated values, enforced by a database `CHECK`:

| Relation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `ref` | generic reference (the default; reach for it when unsure) |
| `part-of` | composition: A is part of B |
| `depends` | dependency: A depends on B |
| `implements` | A implements a concept/interface B |
| `documents` | A describes B |
| `supersedes` | A replaces an older B |
| `contradicts` | A and B conflict |
| `mentions` | A's body links to B |

Edges grow from three places: the **compiler** creates `pending` edges using the vocabulary above; **answer filing** points a query page at the evidence pages it used (`ref`); and when you **approve a page**, the system resolves the `[[wikilinks]]` in its body into `mentions` edges — linking only to pages that actually exist, so a link to a missing page stays a "dangling link" for lint rather than fabricating a node. None of the three needs a model, so they can run automatically while keeping the human in the loop: the approve action itself is the signal that "these links are trustworthy".

> When migrating to v21, the assorted historical relation values in an old store are **normalized** into these eight (for example, legacy `compiled-from` and `cites` fold into `ref`, `depends-on` into `depends`). This relabels only; it never drops an edge, and parallel edges between the same pair that collapse to one value are merged.

lint also runs three **structural checks** along relation type (all pure SQL/in-memory, no model, no cost): whether a `supersedes` edge is inverted (the superseder is older than what it supersedes), whether `part-of`/`depends` form a cycle, and whether a `contradicts` is one-sided (a contradiction should be symmetric). Like every other check, they **only write project todos for a human to read — lint never auto-edits a page or deletes an edge**.

### Pending and approved (the one most often mistaken for a bug)

Pages have a status, and status decides whether a page may answer anything:

- `approved`: searchable, listed in the export index, usable as Q&A evidence.
- `pending`: **visible but not searchable**. Lists, the export bypass, the review queue and lint all see it; retrieval and Q&A deliberately do not.

So "I generated a page but search cannot find it" is not a defect: anything a model wrote is pending until a human approves it. Pages created manually in the app, and answers you file via File as page, are `approved` at birth — those are human actions. Only compiler output lands as `pending`. Rejecting a pending page deletes that row and cascades its links and source attachments; rejecting is explicitly refused for approved pages.

### Who writes pages

1. **Humans**: filing an answer as a `query` page, and future manual page creation.
2. **The compiler** (once `wiki_compile` is on): it reads one note and proposes which pages to create, which links to add, which sources to declare — all landing as `pending`. It **can only create; it can never edit an approved page** — a revision request becomes a todo for a human instead. Every page it produces is automatically attached to the note it read.
3. **Community synthesis** (once `wiki_community_summary` is on *and* a person clicks "Run synthesis" on the review page): it finds topics in the graph of approved pages and drafts one `pending` `synthesis` page per topic. The page, its `documents` edges and its source-note attachments are all built by code; the model only writes the body paragraph (see "Community synthesis" below).
4. **Lint** (read-only): it inspects graph health and never edits a page.

(Merge is a fifth thing, but it is a human-only graph rewrite rather than one more automated writer — see "Concept merge" below.)

### Memory layers (L3 → L0)

"What this project is" and "a raw session transcript" should not carry equal weight in one context. `LayeredProjectContext` assembles memory by stability, and Q&A uses the same two top layers:

| Layer | Contents | When fetched |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| L3 global profile | **Approved** pages owned by no project (cross-project conventions, preferences) | always, first |
| L2 project scenario | repository list + mined tech stack: what the project is | always, second |
| L1 notes | curated knowledge (hand-written, Claude/OpenClaw/Hermes memory files, filed answers) | **only when a specific question is asked** |
| L0 transcripts | session records (codex / opencode / cursor imports, and kind=log) | only on explicit request |

Three points: the classification is a **provenance heuristic** — it says where a note came from, not how true it is; budgets are **per layer**, so a verbose L0 cannot crowd out the L3/L2 that give the model its bearings; and L3 reads approved pages only, so unreviewed compiler output never steers an answer.

### lint: five checks and what they emit

`RunWikiLint` performs five checks. Three are decidable in SQL — orphan pages, missing cross-references, and data gaps (thin pages, pages without a source note, body links pointing at nonexistent pages, leaf pages with no synthesis). The other two, contradictions and stale claims, ask a model and require `wiki_lint_llm` to be explicitly enabled. Every finding becomes a project todo prefixed `[lint]`; re-running does not pile up duplicates (dedupe matches open todos with the same title; a finding that reappears after you ticked it off is new information). One rule is structural rather than advisory: lint produces suggestions, and no code path lets it rewrite a page. (Merge judging also hangs off this lint pass's model half, as a second thing the same run does — see "Concept merge" below.)

### Page version history (schema v22, [ADR-0021](../adr/0021-temporal-graph-page-versions.md))

Notes have had `note_versions` all along; pages did not — `wiki_pages.content` is overwritten in place, so "what did the human actually approve, and what did it become afterwards" had no answer. v22 adds `page_versions`: a snapshot of each page's **approved** content.

- **The writer is a database trigger, not application code.** It freezes a snapshot when a page becomes `approved`, and when an **already-approved** page's content, title or kind changes. `pending` drafts and `rejected` tombstones are never snapshotted — they are not conclusions. Turning an approved page into a tombstone (a merge or a reject) moves the trigger's `new.status` away from `approved`, so its WHEN clause is false and no junk version is written.
- **Append-only is a trigger, not a policy**: `BEFORE UPDATE` / `BEFORE DELETE` both `RAISE(ABORT)`. "Cleaning up the history table" means deliberately dropping those two triggers first, editing, then re-adding them — that is the point, and what it buys is non-repudiation.
- **There is deliberately no foreign key on `page_versions.page_id`.** This is worth writing down for users and for whoever maintains this next: SQLite fires row triggers for foreign-key CASCADE actions, so a cascading FK plus the append-only guard together makes `DELETE FROM wiki_pages` — and therefore deleting a whole project, which cascades through `wiki_pages` — fail as "append-only". You can have one, not both: an audit row that vanishes the moment the thing it records is deleted is not an audit row. So snapshots outlive the page they describe, and the history of a deleted page stays readable.
- **The backfill**: migration v22 files one baseline snapshot for every page that was already approved, guarded per page by `NOT EXISTS`, so it is safe on every database open — it can neither overwrite nor duplicate a real snapshot.
- The review page can list a page's versions and show a **line diff** of any snapshot against the current content (the same +/- format as note version history, in the same version → current direction).

**What is NOT implemented, stated plainly**: `revise_page` — a compiler op that proposes a revision of an approved page. ADR-0021 Decision 4 defers it explicitly until a real stale-approved-page case exists; today a revision still surfaces as a `[lint] compile-revision` todo for a human rather than the system editing the page.

### Concept merge ([ADR-0019](../adr/0019-entity-resolution-merge.md))

The compiler writes one note at a time, so concepts split. ADR-0015 accepted "concepts will split, a human merges them" as the price of that design but shipped no merge tool. The review page now has a **merge suggestions** area.

- **Candidate discovery is structural, free, with no model and no vector.** Four signals: shared source notes, slug shape (one is a prefix of the other, or they are within 2-rune edit distance), title word overlap, and an existing `ref` / `mentions` edge between the two pages. A pair needs **at least two independent signals** to be reported (the two cheapest sum to exactly the threshold). `contradicts` and `supersedes` edges are deliberately **not** similarity signals — they assert that the two pages are different things.
- **Cost stays bounded**: pairs only ever form between pages that share a token, a slug prefix, a source note or an edge — never a full cross product; a bucket larger than 40 pages is skipped outright (that is the stopword guard — a word like `project` or `api` that appears everywhere carries no similarity information).
- **The model is a second opinion only**, gated behind **two** switches (`wiki_lint_llm` AND `wiki_merge_suggest`, both default off). Its verdict becomes a single `[lint] merge [[loser]] → [[winner]]` todo — it cannot merge anything.
- **Merging is human-only, from the review page, behind a two-step confirm.** It is an **absorption, not an edit**: the winner's row is byte-for-byte untouched (content, slug, `updated_at` all unchanged), the loser's edges and source notes are redirected to the winner, and the loser becomes a "merged into" tombstone — the row is kept, exactly like reject ≠ delete, because deleting it would cascade away its inbound edges and turn every page that cited it into a dead link. Cross-project merges are refused in the MVP (a global page, project_id 0, may sit on either side).
- **No `page_merges` audit table was created**, per ADR-0019 Decision 6's own instruction not to build one until a real undo request exists. The loser's tombstone plus the version snapshot frozen while it was approved is the audit record.

### Community synthesis ([ADR-0020](../adr/0020-community-synthesis.md))

`synthesis` is the fifth page kind, and until now it had **no generation path at all** — which meant lint's `no-synthesis` check (a pile of leaf pages, zero syntheses) could never be turned green. This step adds the generation path, so the check can now actually pass.

- **Topics are detected by Label Propagation over the page graph**, propagating only along `ref / part-of / depends / implements / documents`. `contradicts`, `mentions` and `supersedes` are excluded on purpose — conflict, a passing mention and a supersession in time each mean something other than "the same topic".
- The implementation is **synchronous (Jacobi) with a lexicographic tie-break and one self-vote per node**, so the same graph always yields a byte-identical partition. That determinism is what makes re-running safe rather than churning the graph.
- **Input is approved pages only, and synthesis pages are excluded from their own input** — otherwise run N's output enlarges run N+1's input, the member set grows by one each run, the stable slug stops being stable, the revision todo never fires, and a machine-written summary starts summarizing itself.
- Each community produces one `synthesis` page with `status=pending` and `source=wiki-community`, and a stable slug `synthesis-<first 8 hex of sha256 over the sorted member slug list>`. The member → synthesis `documents` edges and the members' source-note attachments are created by code. The model writes **only the paragraph of body text** — it has no vocabulary in which to name a page or a link, so it cannot invent a page through this path.
- If the slug is already held by an **approved** page, it is never rewritten: a `[lint] synthesis-revision` todo is filed instead.
- **Budgets**: ≤10 communities per run, ≤24 member pages each, ≤1500 bytes per page body, wall clock bounded by the batch timeout; when a budget is hit the report says where it stopped (which communities were left for next time, which body was clipped).
- Gated by `wiki_community_summary` (default off), **never on a timer**, and there is **no MCP tool** — an agent able to pour summaries into the library would be the human gate, bypassed. It requires an explicit project (project id 0 means the *global* tier — pages belonging to no project — not "all projects").
- Thresholds are configurable: `community_min_size` (default 3) and `community_max_size` (default 30).
- **An honest limitation**: Label Propagation's boundaries are fuzzy. The algorithm's own test keeps a concrete failure on record — two triangles joined by a single bridge do not split cleanly: the bridge node defects to one side, and the stranded remainder can fall *below* `community_min_size` and be discarded, so a topic silently gets no summary. The report surfaces `dropped_small` / `dropped_large` counts so "nothing found" can be told apart from "fragmented graph" and "one giant blob".

### Export to Obsidian (a read-only bypass)

```
go build -o repotory-wiki-export ./cmd/wiki-export
./repotory-wiki-export -out ./vault            # refused if the target holds foreign files
```

It renders `vault/wiki/<entities|concepts|sources|synthesis|queries>/<slug>.md` with YAML frontmatter (including `status` and `source`), `[[wikilink]]` outgoing and back links, a `wiki/index.md` catalogue and `EXPORT-MANIFEST.json`. Its purpose is **to look at the graph**: Obsidian's graph view answers whether this taxonomy is actually the shape of your knowledge. Two deliberate properties:

- **One-way**: edits made in Obsidian never flow back. That is a decision, not a missing feature — two writers would mean a second implementation of versioning, de-duplication and link consistency (see [ADR-0014](../adr/0014-llm-wiki-knowledge-compiler.md) Decision 2).
- **Nothing is deleted**: files left behind by deleted pages are reported as stale and are yours to clean. The export never claims ownership of that tree.

`index.md` lists approved pages only, so an unreviewed page cannot be routed into; pending pages are still exported, tagged `status: pending`, which is exactly where review happens.

## Export

- **Export .md** on the note card copies the Markdown — with YAML frontmatter (title / tags / project / type / updated time) — to the clipboard. For bulk AI consumption, see llms.txt in [AI integration](ai-integration.md).
- **OMP-style memory export** (`ExportMemoryJSON`): dumps the knowledge base as OMP (Open Memory Protocol) style Memory Objects for other tools speaking that protocol. **Export only — there is no import side**, and the field mapping is still marked provisional: the protocol itself is not stable, so two-way sync was deliberately left undone. It is reachable through the app binding layer; there is no dedicated button yet.
