# Repotory Documentation

<p class="subtitle"><strong>The local-first memory layer for AI coding agents</strong> — automatically discover local Git projects, understand what changed and what knowledge has been captured, and hand searchable project context to any agent at session boundaries.</p>

<!--NAV_LINKS-->

## Product Positioning

The core value of Repotory: **turning local Git projects from things scattered across terminals and memory into searchable, reusable context**.

Current priorities:

1. **Local project understanding and knowledge context** comes first
2. The dashboard and statistics are supporting capabilities, not the main product story
3. Plugin/web-only capabilities are no longer expanded by default (the PWA has been removed from the main desktop build; see [ADR-0008](adr/0008-pwa-removal.md))

The frontend landing page is the **knowledge base**, and the navigation order is **Knowledge base → Dashboard → Settings** (see [ADR-0006](adr/0006-scope-freeze.md)).

The core loop:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    D[Discover] --> U[Understand]
    U --> R[Capture]
    R --> S[Retrieve]
    S --> A[Hand to AI]
    A -. session boundaries .-> D
```

The five steps map one-to-one onto the five capabilities listed at the end of this section. The dashed edge is what separates Repotory from a plain notes tool: capturing knowledge is not the end state — it is the input of the next session.

The session memory loop (both ends of the protocol):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent<br/>(Claude Code / Cursor /<br/>VS Code extension)
    participant RN as Repotory<br/>(MCP / headless /<br/>desktop)
    participant KB as Local knowledge base<br/>(SQLite + FTS5)
    Agent->>RN: repotory_scan (first run, no desktop app needed)
    RN->>KB: seed scan roots, discover<br/>Git repos, mine knowledge
    Agent->>RN: repotory_context (session start)
    RN->>KB: tech stack / README / todos /<br/>notes, handoffs first
    KB-->>Agent: one call, full project context
    Note over Agent,KB: …work happens…
    Agent->>RN: repotory_handoff (session end)
    RN->>KB: structured handoff persisted,<br/>tagged 'handoff'
    Note over KB,Agent: the next session (any agent) reads it automatically
```

How to read it: the three participants are **three separate processes** — the AI side holds no data, Repotory does not schedule agents, and the knowledge base is the only place the two meet. The upper half is cold start (`repotory_scan`) and session open (`repotory_context`); the lower half is session close (`repotory_handoff`). That last Note is the proof the loop closes: once the handoff is persisted, **the next session — possibly run by a different agent — reads it back automatically** via `repotory_context`, with nothing carried over by hand.

The "hand it to AI" step happens at **session boundaries**: `repotory_scan` builds the knowledge base, `repotory_context` injects the full context once when a session starts, and `repotory_handoff` captures a structured handoff when it ends — reusable across agents.

- **Discover**: automatically scans local Git repositories and intelligently groups them (monorepo / single repo)
- **Understand**: project details automatically surface a README summary, tech stack, dependencies, contributors, and activity
- **Capture**: Markdown notes (categories / tags / version history), with Claude memory import
- **Retrieve**: FTS5 full-text search (with a fallback for short CJK queries); hits can be located and explained
- **AI consumption**: the MCP session memory protocol (`repotory_scan` / `repotory_context` / `repotory_handoff`) plus llms.txt, ready for direct consumption by Claude Code, Cursor, and others

Feature tiers (core / supporting / experimental / deferred) and the scope-freeze rules are described in [ADR-0006](adr/0006-scope-freeze.md).

## The Big Picture: two audiences, one set of artifacts

Repotory's artifacts serve two audiences at once: **you, sitting in the IDE** (who need to see it and click it) and **AI agents** (who need to read it and write it). Both paths share one local knowledge base — which is exactly why switching agents never loses context:

```

How to read it: **the top two rows are the shelf** — the desktop App and the VS Code extension meet humans, the MCP toolset, dsh plugin and llms.txt meet agents; **the middle is the vault** — every entry point calls the same service layer with zero logic duplication; **the wiring operator stands to the side** — `repotory-init` connects the agent side in one command (writes `.mcp.json` / `.cursor` / `.vscode`, installs the SessionEnd hook so the handoff always fires at session end). Solid arrows all point inward at `internal/service`: no entry point bypasses it to talk to the database (exceptions noted in [Architecture](architecture.md#layering-backend)), which is why all three surfaces behave identically. The only dashed line is `repotory-init`: it writes only toward the agent side because it is a **run-once-at-install** wiring action. One invisible flow is worth knowing — the Markdown export and version history of `internal/service` are readable artifacts that ultimately serve the person (the full distribution argument lives in [ADR-0009](adr/0009-ide-presence.md)).
