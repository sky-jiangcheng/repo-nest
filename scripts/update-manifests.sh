# the real digests of the published release. It only touches a manifest when
# the exact asset that manifest's URL points at has a digest available, so a
# partial release leaves the remaining placeholders in place instead of writing
# a digest that does not correspond to the download.
#
# Two digest sources:
#   --fill-sha256                reads assets/releases/v<version>/SHA256SUMS
#                                (offline path: build locally first, or use the
#                                file the release workflow already produced)
#   --fill-sha256 --from-api     reads the per-asset digest the GitHub Release
#                                API reports for the tag (recommended: matches
#                                what the release actually serves, no download;
#                                anonymous access, 60 req/h is ample for one run)
