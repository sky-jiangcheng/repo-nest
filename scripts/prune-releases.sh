# Prune historical GitHub releases.
#
# The repository has accumulated ~40 releases and >1 GB of uploaded assets.
# Older ones are no longer downloadable from anywhere else, so this is
# destructive and irreversible: deleting a release removes its assets
# permanently. Git tags are NOT removed unless you pass --delete-tags.
#
# Safety properties, in order of importance:
#   1. Dry run by default. Nothing is deleted without --yes.
#   2. Fails immediately if gh is missing or unauthenticated, rather than
#      part-way through a delete loop.
#   3. Always keeps the most recent --keep releases, so you cannot prune down
#      to zero by accident.
#   4. Prints exactly what it will delete, and the bytes reclaimed, before
#      asking.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/prune-releases.sh --keep 3            # show what would go
#   ./scripts/prune-releases.sh --keep 3 --yes      # do it
#   ./scripts/prune-releases.sh --keep 3 --yes --delete-tags
#   ./scripts/prune-releases.sh --list              # inventory only
